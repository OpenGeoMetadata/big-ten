  "dc_description_s": "Anne Arundel County, Maryland is interested in monitoring its changing land use for planning, zoning and environmental protection purposes. The County is under increasing development pressure and needs to maintain an accurate land use/impervious database so it may guide development in a sustainable way from both economic and environmental perspectives. Impervious surfaces are defined as artificial structures that are covered by impenetrable materials, which eliminate stormwater infiltration and increase storm water runoff. This map layer, unlike the previous Countywide impervious layers created by Sanborn Mapping Company and its predecessors (Space Imaging), was manually digitized using heads-up processes. Planimetric data acquired by the county via the 2007 aerial imagery was used as a basis for this update. Impervious features not captured in the 2007 planimetrics were added, as well as any major changed surfaces. Impervious features that no longer exist on the ground were deleted. This task was derived from the 2011 Maryland Statewide Aerial Photography Project imagery, which has a 6-inch pixel resolution. The imagery acquisition was conducted between March 7, 2011 \u2013 April 15, 2011(Leaf off conditions) and the imagery Meets ASPRS Class 1 standards at map scale 1:1200 (1\u201d = 100\u2019). The impervious surface map layer is classified into 11 classes that include Athletic courts, Buildings, Driveways, Other paved areas, Parking lots, Patios/Decks, Piers, Rails, Roads/Highways, Sidewalks, and Swimming pools. The map layer is stored in an ESRI File Geodatabase format with a spatial reference defined as Maryland State Plane NAD 1983 Feet. The Minimum Mapping Unit for this layer is 100 square feet.NOTE: After accepting the final delivery from Sanborn, Anne Arundel County made several changes to the data.  The Sports fields classification was changed to Athletic courts and all astroturf fields were removed.  The Rails classification was added by buffering the County's rails layer.  Playgrounds and trampolines were included in the original delivery but the County plans to remove these in the near future.The 2007 planimetric files originated in shapefile format, with each impervious type as its own shapefile. Prior to change updates, they were migrated to feature classes in an ESRI File GeoDatabase format, and once the updates were complete the individual feature classes were merged into one topologically correct feature class.",
