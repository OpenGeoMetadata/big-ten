On any given night, somewhere in the City a neighborhood group is meeting, discussing community concerns, planning for their collective future and advocating for action. BNIA-JFI currently tracks nine neighborhood and community indicators to measure the extent to which the City\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffds neighborhoods are active, organized, and empowered. These include: the number of neighborhood associations and block groups; the number of Community Development Corporations (CDCs); the number of umbrella organizations; the number of park stewardship groups; the number of community gardens; Healthy Neighborhood Initiative locations; the number of historic properties; the percentage of the population registered to vote; and the percentage of persons voting.",
