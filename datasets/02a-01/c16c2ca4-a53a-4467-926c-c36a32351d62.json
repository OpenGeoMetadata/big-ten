  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is 1 ppsm LiDAR point cloud data and derivative models of Kankakee County, Illinois. Kankakee County is approximately 677 square miles (1753 square kilometers) in north eastern Illinois. Data was collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Data acquisition, processing and assessment is compliant with procedures and methods stated in U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program LiDAR Base Specification Version 1.0 and Federal Emergency Management Agency Procedure Memorandum 61. This dataset consists of LiDAR LAS swath files and tiled LAS files. Tiled LAS files contain LiDAR point information which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Tiled LAS and derived data models are named according to the coordinates at the south west corner of the tile. Quantum Spatial Project No: 1140310.01",
