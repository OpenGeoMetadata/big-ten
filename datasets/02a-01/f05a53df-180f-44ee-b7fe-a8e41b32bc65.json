  "dc_description_s": "This data set contains imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availabilty of ortho imagery within a year of acquisition. NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQS) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 20 meters of reference DOQQs. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 360 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are rectified to the UTM coordinate system NAD83. NAIP imagery can obtain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.",
