Features depicted are limited to well documented, significant anticlines, synclines and monoclines in Illinois. Names of the features and the geologic horizons (bedrock unit) on which they were mapped are included. This data set must be used in conjunction with the other feature classes in this dataset for a full representation of Plate 1 of ISGS Bulletin 100.",
