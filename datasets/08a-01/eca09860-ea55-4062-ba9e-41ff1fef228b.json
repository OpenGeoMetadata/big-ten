Flight operations began on 12/11/09 and ended on 04/10/10 using an (DMC) camera with an approximate forward overlap of 60% and side overlap of 30% with an approximate Ground Sample Distance of (44 cm). The dataset is projected as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 17 on the North American Datum of 1983. The PAMAP Program LiDAR Data of Pennsylvania; West Virginia Statewide Digital Elevation Models; USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) - (Used in the respective sequential order) were utilized as the Digital Elevation Model in ortho-processing.",
