  "dc_description_s": "Orthoimagery for south-central Pennsylvania captured in April of 2003. An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 2-feet pixel resolution. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 4.8 feet at the 95% confidence level. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator \"PA\", and the State Plane zone designator \"S\".",
