  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using the National Wetlands Inventory originated by the US Fish & Wildlife Service. Conservation values were determined by SmartConservationTM methodology developed by Natural Lands Trust using the attribute field \"Attribute\" as follows: Old Values New Values U 0 FL; FL/US; RB; RS; SB; UB; US; BB 1 AB; AB/UB; UB/AB; AB/OW; FL/OW; OW 2 UB/EM; UB/FO 4 EM; EM/AB; EM/FL; EM/FO; EM/OW; EM/SS; EM/UB; 10 FO; FO/EM; FO/OW; FO/SS; FO/UB; 10 SS; SS/EM; SS/FO; SS/OW; SS/UB 10 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation\\xae. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the expanded piedmont ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
