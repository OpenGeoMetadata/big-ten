  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created by calculating the average of impervious surface for the small watersheds for years 1985 and 2000. The difference between these was then calculated by subtracting the 1985 data from the 2000 data. The output was reclassified into ten quantiles in order to assign Conservation Value as follows: Impervious Surface Change Value -0.085069 - -0.085069 10 -0.085069 - 0.102853 9 0.102853 - 0.290775 8 0.290775 - 0.478697 7 0.478697 - 0.666619 6 0.666619 - 1.042463 5 1.042463 - 1.606229 4 1.606229 - 2.54584 3 2.54584 - 4.800905 2 4.800905 - 48.022984 1 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation\\xc2\\xae. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
