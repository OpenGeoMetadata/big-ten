  "dc_description_s": "The Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) developed a map package for watershed groups and county conservation districts within the Pennsylvania portion of the basin. Map packages were distributed to 44 non-profit groups in 22 counties, covering 52 watersheds equaling 8,300 square miles in Pennsylvania. The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Growing Greener Grant Program. The map packages were tailored to each groups watershed and featured four geographic themes geology, land cover, soils, and watersheds. In addition, abandoned mine lands, political boundaries and hydrologic features, such as wetlands, were incorporated, where applicable. Large (28 x 36) and small (8.5 x 11) format map images are included. Organizations can use the data and maps to plan and assess watershed conditions and determine methods to improve the quality of the waters.",
