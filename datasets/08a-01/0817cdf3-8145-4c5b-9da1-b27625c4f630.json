  "dc_description_s": "Originally created for the PAMAP Project (Warner et al., 2007) land cover classification and interpretation was completed specifically for Pennsylvania to update potential habitat modeling for Pennsylvania and include interpretation to capture changes in urban and suburban development. Following a modified Anderson Level 2 system (Anderson et al., 1976) photo interpretation was expanded to further classify suburban/urban areas based on housing density and to better identify land uses such as golf courses and surface mines.",
