  "dc_description_s": "County Mosaics MR.SID format - An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The PAMAP 2005 natural color orthoimages were produced at 1-foot pixel resolution. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 x 10,000 ft. block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane South with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The orthoimage filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator \"PA,\" and the State Plane zone designator \"S.\" This dataset consists of 10000 x 10000 ft. uncompressed natural color (24-bit) GeoTIFF files at a pixel resolution of 1 foot. The imagery was captured at a negative scale of 1:19200 for the purpose of producing orthophotos.",
