  "dc_description_s": "The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission is an independent administrative commission. It consists of ten competent citizens of the Commonwealth who are appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent of a majority of the Pennsylvania Senate. Commissioners serve for terms of eight years and continue in office until their successors are appointed. Two members of the Commission serve at large and are experienced in boating and water safety education and owners of Pennsylvania registered boats. The remaining eight members each represent a specific geographic district. They are persons well informed on the subjects of conservation, restoration, fish and fishing and boats and boating. Commissioners are appointed on a bipartisan basis. This GIS layer is a compilation of those 8 geographic districts.",
