  "dc_description_s": "Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to forest economics of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The objective of this analysis was to identify forested lands with the highest economic value. The identification of economically important forest lands focuses on the potential for future economic benefits associated with timber management activities. This considers not only the potential economic return from forest harvest operations, but also the long-term economic sustainability of forest land management and the local importance of the timber management and wood products industry. Other economic benefits related to forest lands, such as tourism and hunting, are not considered in this model. MORE INFORMATION -",
