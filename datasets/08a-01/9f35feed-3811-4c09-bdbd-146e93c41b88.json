  "dc_description_s": "In 2012, catchments were generated in the Delaware River Basin for 8-digit HUCs in areas underlain by the Marcellus Shale (all of 02040101, 02040102, 02040103, 02040104; and headwater areas of 02040106 and 02040203) based on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Strahler first- and second-order streams. At that time, the remaining 8-digit HUCs were not included. The completion of HUCs 02040106 and 02040203, along with HUCs 02040105, 02040201, 02040202, 02040205, 02040206, and 02040207 were part of this current project.",
