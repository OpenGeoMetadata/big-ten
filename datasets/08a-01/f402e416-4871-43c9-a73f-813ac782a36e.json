  "dc_description_s": "Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful illegal dump surveys educate state, county and local officials, as well as citizens, about the problem of illegal dumping and provide valuable data about the dumpsites and the community in which they reside. Illegal dumping mostly occurs in remote and secluded places, rural areas where few persons live, and the roads are less traveled. However, for many people who are residents of an urban area, an illegal dump is often within a one-mile radius of their home. Overall, very few people are aware of the widespread problem of illegal dumping in Pennsylvania.",
