  "dc_description_s": "Change in the District of Columbias tree canopy estimated from 2011 leaf-on imagery and 2006 leaf-on imagery in conjunction with 2008 leaf-off LiDAR. This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed. This dataset has been independently reviewed by two separate organizations.",
