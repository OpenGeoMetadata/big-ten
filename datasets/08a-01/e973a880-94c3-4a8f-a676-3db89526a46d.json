Woolpert's automated land cover feature extraction processes was used to perform impervious surface delineation. Woolpert utilized commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) remote sensing software, proprietary software and applications to perform automated feature analysis incorporating imagery, LiDAR and other ancillary vector data. The automated processes replace the need to manually digitize features.",
