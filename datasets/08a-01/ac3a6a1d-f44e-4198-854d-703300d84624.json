  "dc_description_s": "The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. NED files are available on CD from the EROS data center as 1x1 degree tiles. For online distribution the files on PASDA have been aggregated by county and projected into the Albers Equal Area projection. Data incomplete, areas not mapped when screened at small scales during low level radioactive waste siting analysis.",
