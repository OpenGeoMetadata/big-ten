Crime data are reported by county and are provided for eight crimes: murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Statewide allocation data are not included in this map layer. Crime data are adjusted to compensate for incomplete reporting by individual law enforcement agencies. See the online codebook at for more information. This layer is clipped to Pennsylvania",
