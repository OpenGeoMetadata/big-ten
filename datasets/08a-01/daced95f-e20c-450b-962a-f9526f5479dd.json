  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using inputs including \"Networked Streams of Pennsylvania\" data as originated by Environmental Resources Research Institute (see metadata entitled \"netstreams.htm\" and \"Pennsylvania Land Cover dated 1992\" developed by the EROS Data Center for EPA Federal Region III (see metadata entitled \"Land Cover 1992 EPA Federal Region III.pdf\"). 100 foot buffers of the networked streams were assigned value based on the Strahler stream order and the potential aquatic habitat values assigned to the 1992 land cover. The average conservation value for riparian buffers of 1-2 ordered streams, 3-5 ordered streams, and 6-12 ordered streams were then calculated for the small watersheds (see metadata entitled \"smallsheds.xml\"). Each of the above groups were then weighted and added together and quantiled into 10 classes to create an overall Riparian Buffer Quality by small watershed data set. Conservation values were determined by SmartConservation (registered trademark) methodology. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation\\xae. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the Expanded Piedmont Ecoregion in Pennsylvania. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
