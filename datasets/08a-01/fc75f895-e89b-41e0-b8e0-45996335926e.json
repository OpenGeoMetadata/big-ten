  "dc_description_s": "This layer was created to facilitate ecological understanding by reclassifying the base land cover layer NLCD2001 which was based on satellite imagery collected in the late 1990s. To better understand ecology condition using satellite collected land cover data it is often beneficial to focus on more specific land cover types. This layer groups all the forest classes into one forest class while grouping agriculture, urban and suburban classes into a non-forest class. This allows condition to be assessed using metrics, such as those tabulated using GIS tools found in Fragstats (McGarigal & Marks, 1995), to be consistently calculated within ecological units like watersheds and political units like counties. The resulting raster format layer has three classes: Forest, Non-Forest and Water.",
