All Federal oil and gas resources are leasable subject to stipulations necessary to mitigate or avoid adverse impacts on surface resource values. An analysis was done on each tract to determine surface occupancy conditions necessary to protect significant surface resource values while providing for the extraction of federally owned oil and gas. Federally owned oil and gas rights within the Wilderness and National Recreation Areas are congressionally withdrawn from mineral entry.",
