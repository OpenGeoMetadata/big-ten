  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows service areas for watershed associations in Pennsylvania. These areas represent the parts of the state where watershed associations work. A watershed association is a non-governmental organization whose mission focuses on protecting, restoring health to, or monitoring a specific body of water, or educating on how policies and actions in the watershed impact the water body. A watershed association advances its mission at least in part by performing on-the-ground or in-the-water projects such as streamside tree plantings, aquatic habitat improvements, stream cleanups, and water quality monitoring.",
