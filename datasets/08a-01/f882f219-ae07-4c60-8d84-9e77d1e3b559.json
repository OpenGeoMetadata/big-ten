This layer contains areas in New Jersey as well, only if they are along the Delaware River and around the City of Philadelphia's county lines. This layer can be used for programming and inventory purposes as well. Several launches lie within the Philadelphia Parks and Recreation property but this can be determined by the attribute table information.",
