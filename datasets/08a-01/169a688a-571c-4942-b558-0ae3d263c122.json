  "dc_description_s": "Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to Cultural Assessment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed Growth and development not only threaten lands of high value for water quality and habitat, but also cultural lands that directly connect many citizens in the Bay watershed to the land. Important in preserving heritage and traditional values, cultural lands often define sense of place. The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it. Additionally, the value of an historic or cultural site is often intrinsically tied to the landscape context in which it is located. MORE INFORMATION -",
