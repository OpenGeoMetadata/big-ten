  "dc_description_s": "This dataset displays contour lines covering the Allegheny National Forest (ANF) and surrounding area at 20 foot intervals. Each contour is a line of equal elevation, therefore, contours never cross. They show the general shape of the terrain. Contours that are very close together represent steep slopes. Widely spaced contours or an absence of contours means that the ground slope is relatively level.",
