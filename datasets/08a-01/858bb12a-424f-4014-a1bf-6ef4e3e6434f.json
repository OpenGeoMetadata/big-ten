This file should be used in conjunction with the 30 Year Precipitation dataset (1971-2000) for the Susquehanna River Basin (2006 boundary). The attribute field for inches has been interpolated from the raster's GRIDCODE field. The inch values should be viewed as approximate. The conversion is listed in the Entity Attribute Overview section of the document. This section also lists the correct conversion for the 30 Year Precipitation dataset (1971-2000) for the Susquehanna River Basin.",
