The vulnerability layer evaluates the relative potential risk of future land conversion to urban uses. Vulnerability is defined as function of suitability for development and proximity to growth \"hot spots.\" The vulnerability layers useful as a stand-alone layer to evaluate development trends, but can also be combined with the other RLA layers to prioritize land conservation efforts.
