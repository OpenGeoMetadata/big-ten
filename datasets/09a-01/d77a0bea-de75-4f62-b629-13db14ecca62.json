  "dc_description_s": "BEDROCK_GEOL_RGM_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the bedrock geology of the state of Indiana, produced from the Indiana Geological Survey Regional Geologic Map series, which was mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. The mapped stratigraphic units include selected systems, groups, and formations. Additional attributes were included from derivative products of the \"Compendium of Paleozoic rock-unit stratigraphy in Indiana\u0097a revision: Indiana Geological Survey Bulletin 59 (1986).\" The names of some groups, formations, and members on some of the maps have been updated to reflect the most recent nomenclature.",
