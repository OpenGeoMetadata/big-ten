  "dc_description_s": "HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_UNCLASSIFIED_NHD_IN.SHP is a line shapefile that contains unclassified drainage flowlines in watersheds in and around Indiana. HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_UNCLASSIFIED_NHD_USGS.SHP is derived from the local-resolution version of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), and is current as of November 30, 2016.  This dataset is complete and includes data for all of the following thirty-eight HUC08 subbasins in Indiana: Auglaize (0410007), Blue-Sinking (05140104), Chicago (07120003), Driftwood (05120204), Eel (05120104), Eel (05120203), Flatrock-Haw (05120205), Highland-Pigeon (05140202), Iroquois (07120002), Kankakee (07120001) Little Calumet-Galien (04040001), Lower East Fork White (05120208), Lower Great Miami (05080002), Lower Ohio-Little Pigeon (05140201), Lower Wabash (05120113), Lower White (05120202), Middle Wabash-Busseron (05120111), Middle Wabash-Deer (05120105), Middle Wabash-Little Vermilion (05120108), Middle Ohio-Laughery (05090203), Mississinewa (05120103), Muscatatuck (05120207), Patoka (05120209), Salamonie (05120102), Silver-Little Kentucky (05140101), St. Joseph (04050001), St. Joseph-Maumee (04100003), St. Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (04100004), Sugar (05120110), Tippecanoe (05120106), Upper East Fork White (05120206), Upper Great Miami (05080001), Upper Maumee (04100005), Upper Wabash (05120101), Upper White (05120201), Vermilion (05120109), Whitewater (05080003), Wildcat (05120107).  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named \"NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN\":  \"In order to meet the USGS NHD data model for flowlines, all new flowlines resulting from the Indiana NHD local resolution upgrade project that could not be categorized (artificial path, canal/ditch, coastline, connector, pipeline, stream/river perennial, stream/river intermittent, or underground conduit) were given an FTYPE of Stream/River and an FCODE of Stream/River (46000). Those features are considered to be Unclassified Flowlines and were loaded into this dataset. Records from the reprojected NHDFlowline feature class where FCODE = 46000 were loaded into this dataset. An 'INDIANA_CLASS' field was added to the feature class and all records were given a value of 'Unclassified Flowline.' The 'FCODE' and 'FTYPE' attribute fields were then deleted. All records from the source NHDFlowlines where 'FCODE' <> 46000 can be found in the Classified Flowline dataset.\"  \"The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",
