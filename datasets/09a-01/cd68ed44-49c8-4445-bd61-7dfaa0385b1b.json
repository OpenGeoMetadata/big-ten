  "dc_description_s": "ZCTA_TIGER05_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA's) for the state of Indiana. This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs):  \"ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs\u0099) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  \u0095 ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  \u0095 ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPS\u0092s ZIP Code delivery areas.  \u0095 ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  \u0095 ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  \u0095 ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  \u0095 ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  \u0095 ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  \u0095 ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  \u0095 ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another.\"  For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:  \"The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.\"",
