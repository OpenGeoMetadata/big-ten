COAL_MINE_MINED_OUT_HYMERA_IN_2014 includes mine locations from documented surface and underground mines that operated in Indiana since the late 1800s. COAL_MINE_MINED_OUT_HYMERA_IN_2014 is attributed to allow the mine polygons to be differentiated based on mine number, county name, and mine type (surface or underground).",
