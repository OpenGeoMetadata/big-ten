  "dc_description_s": "The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) area sampling frame is a delineation of all parcels of land for the purpose of later sampling the parcels.  The area frame is constructed by visually interpreting satellite imagery to divide a state into homogenous land use areas (strata) based on percent cultivated.  The strata are typically defined as low, medium, or high percent cultivated, nonagricultural land, urban use, agri-urban, or water.  The boundaries of the strata usually follow identifiable features such as roads, railroads, and waterways.  The strata boundaries do not coincide with any political boundaries, with the exception of state boundaries.",
