  "dc_description_s": "BENCHMARKS_CORS_NOAA_IN.SHP is a subset of the associated shapefile named \"BENCHMARKS_NOAA_IN.SHP.\" It shows the locations of 47 actively maintained continuously operating reference stations (CORS) in Indiana.  The following is excerpted from the CORS website maintained by by NOAA and the National Geodedic Survey (NGS):  \"The National Geodetic Survey (NGS), an office of NOAA's National Ocean Service, manages a network of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) that provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data consisting of carrier phase and code range measurements in support of three dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather, and geophysical applications throughout the United States, its territories, and a few foreign countries.  \"Surveyors, GIS users, engineers, scientists, and the public at large that collect GPS data can use CORS data to improve the precision of their positions. CORS enhanced post-processed coordinates approach a few centimeters relative to the National Spatial Reference System, both horizontally and vertically.  \"The CORS network is a multi-purpose cooperative endeavor involving government, academic, and private organizations. The sites are independently owned and operated. Each agency shares their data with NGS, and NGS in turn analyzes and distributes the data free of charge. As of August 2015, the CORS network almost 2,000 stations, contributed by over 200 different organizations, and the network continues to expand.\"",
