  "dc_description_s": "The 1994 State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database for Indiana, obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), was used to create SOILS_STATSGO_SHRINK_SWELL_IN showing the shrink-swell characteristics of soils in Indiana. The most restrictive shrink-swell characteristic of the soil layer was used to represent the component soil. The component soil values were then assigned to a map unit based on the percentage of that component soil in the map unit. A category was calculated for the map unit based on the most restrictive category at the 70th percentile of the map unit.",
