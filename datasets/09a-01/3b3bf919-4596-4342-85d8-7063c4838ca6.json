  "dc_description_s": "Historical census data for minor civil divisions (also known as \"civil townships\") in Indiana were provided by personnel of the Indiana Business Research Center to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The data were joined by personnel of IGS to a shapefile of minor civil divisions. The historical census data consisted of population statistics from 1890 to 2000. The boundaries of civil townships are not believed to have changed greatly during the past 110 years. Using these data, personnel of the IGS calculated population density for each civil township during census years and changes of density for each decadal period.",
