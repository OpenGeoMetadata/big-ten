  "dc_description_s": "NPDES_FACILITY_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program Facilities in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Water Quality (IDEM, OWQ) as of October 8, 2013. The most recent update provided by IDEM was an ESRI point feature class named \"ICIS_FACILITIES.\" NPDES_FACILITY_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility information, contact information, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates were originally obtained by IDEM from the Environnmental Protection Agency (EPA) Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) database (website location: http://www.epa.gov/compliance/data/systems/icis/).  NOTE: The original feature class named \"ICIS_FACILITIES\" provided by IDEM contains many attribute records that do not contain location and coordinate system information. There are a total of 1,792 attribute records provided in this data layer. Of those, a total of only 1,441 records contain locational information and are displayed in a spatial map view. The remaining 351 records have been retained in the attribute table to aid users of these data in performing environmental accessments in the state of Indiana.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OWQ for the source feature class ICIS_FACILITIES:  \"The data set provides an important map layer for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management staff in conducting environmental assessments as well as a direct source or contact and mailing information. Although the database record set depicts all available information on regulated wastewater discharge sites as of the date of extraction, the locational and coordinate information is not complete, therefore queries and other searches are best handled through the attribute tables rather than from visually on maps where not all sites are represented.  This database is extracted from the national EPA Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) database and includes all available records listed in Indiana associated with \"Active\" surface water discharges. It consists of primarily of state permitted and regulated wastewater facility related information. The files are point locations and are projected into a UTM NAD83 zone 16 North coordinate system. Facility name, contacts, and a variety of mailing addresses are included for each permit along with locational data as available. Additionally, records for Stormwater permits under Rule 6, stormwater associated with industrial activities, have been appended into the tables.\"",
