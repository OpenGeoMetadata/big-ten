The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR, Division of Outdoor Recreation, for the source feature class named LAKE_BATHYMETRY_DNR_IN:  \"Lake_Bathymetry_DNR_IN is a polyine feature dataset of bathymetric contours for certain Indiana lakes, depicting the depths of the water with the shoreline of each lake as elevation 0. Contour intervals are 5 feet for most lakes, 2 feet for some. Lakes were surveyed using Biosonics DTX Echosounder surface unit and 200 kHz and 420 kHz transducers. The contour values of some lakes were adjusted to coincide with the lake's legal gauge level.\"",
