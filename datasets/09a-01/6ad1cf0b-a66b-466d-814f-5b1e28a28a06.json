  "dc_description_s": "POWER_HAZUS_IN is a point shapefile that shows locations of electric power facilities in Indiana. POWER_HAZUS_IN was derived from the shapefile named \"ELECTRIC.\" A predecessor shapefile of ELECTRIC, named \"EFA.SHP,\" was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). The shapefile was included on a CD-ROM (titled \"arcHAZUS97, Eastern US\") that is the product of a program referred to as \"HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating Earthquake Losses.\" The original shapefile (referred to as \"EFA.SHP\") has been modified by personnel of the IGS. This metadata was created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from a FEMA Database (1992)(HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases).",
