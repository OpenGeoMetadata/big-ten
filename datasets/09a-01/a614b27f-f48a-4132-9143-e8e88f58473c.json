The imagery was collected between the dates of April 11, 2003 and August 26, 2003. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The Indiana data layer is aggregated to 13 standardized categories for display purposes with the emphasis being agricultural land cover.  This is part of an annual series in which several states are categorized annually based on the extensive field observations collected during the annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. However, no farmer reported data is included or derivable on the Cropland Data Layer CD-ROM.\"",
