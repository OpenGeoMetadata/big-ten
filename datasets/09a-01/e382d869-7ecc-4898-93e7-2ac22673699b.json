These data include five categories: (1) buried reef masses, (2) exposed reef, (3) exposed reef in active stone quarries, (4) reef-induced structure in overlying rocks, and (5) reef-induced structure in overlying rocks related to oil, gas, and gas storage fields.  This shapefile can be used in conjunction with SILURIAN_REEF_POLYGONS_MM54_IN.",
