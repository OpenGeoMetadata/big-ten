  "dc_description_s": "Federal Urban Code lists the U.S. Census federal adjusted urban area a road segment is assigned to. Functional class is the level of service of a route or segment of a route. The Interregional Corridor system has been retired and is no longer used to measure performance or as an investment category. Through federal legislation, the National Highway System was expanded and performance measures for mobility on the NHS have been developed. National Truck Network is a network of approved routes for commercial truck drivers in the United States. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 authorized the establishment of a national network of highways designated for use by large trucks. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in Non Measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on Roadway and Truck Networks in Minnesota.",
