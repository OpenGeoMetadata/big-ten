The wetlands are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). MPCA adds additional wetlands. Since the impaired lakes are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset.  This dataset includes impaired wetlands which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA.",
