See the <i>DNR Ecological and Water Resources</i>  website at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/waters/watermgmt_section/wild_scenic/wsrivers/rivers.html for more information on classification and management of these designated rivers.   Designated segments are maintained as tabular data and displayed as linear events on the <a href=\"../../water_measured_kittle_routes/metadata/metadata.html\" target=_blank>Stream Routes with Kittle Numbers and Mile Measures</a> layer.  In the attribute table, designated segments extend from the FROM_MEAS (mile) to the TO_MEAS (mile) and have a total length = [LENGTH_MI] on a route with total length = [ROUTE_MI].",
