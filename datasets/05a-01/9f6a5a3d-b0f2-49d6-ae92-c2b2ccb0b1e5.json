The roads are attributed with information based on their designated route.   **MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in non-measured which does not contain calibrations.  These files are good for reference material.  The other version without the non-measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures.  These versions require contacting MnDOT to obtain.  The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. **",
