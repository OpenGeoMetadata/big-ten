  "dc_description_s": "This dataset represents the locations, classifications, and physical characteristics of remediation activities carried out by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The locations represent leak clean up, emergency response, petroleum brownfields, non-petroleum brownfields (Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup), Superfund, RCRA, integrated remediation and site assessment sites. The geodatabase, env_remediation_sites.gdb, contains two related datasets: (1) the remediation_sites point feature class, which has one record for each remediation site, and (2) the spatial_rem_activity table, which contains one record for each MPCA effort to investigate contamination at a site. The two datasets can be related using the ITEM_ID. In most cases, there will be one record in spatial_rem_activity for each record in remediation_sites. However, reopened leak sites may have multiple records in spatial_rem_activity for a single site, and CERCLIS/SEMS sites where the EPA was the lead agency may have zero records in spatial_rem_activity. The spatial_rem_activity table only exists in the file geodatabase format of this dataset.",
