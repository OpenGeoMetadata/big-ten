This database contains the actual location of section corners, rather than the location of the bearing trees themselves. The data are derived from land surveyor notes, which include descriptions of vegetation and landscape characteristics along survey transects. This database is described in greater detail in the publication: Minnesota's Bearing Tree Database, by John Almendinger, Biological Report No. 56, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 1997.",
