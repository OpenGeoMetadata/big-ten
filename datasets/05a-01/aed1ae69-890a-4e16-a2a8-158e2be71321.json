This 2000 census redistricting geography database of the 7 county metropolitan area and the additional 12 collar county area was developed from the U.S.  Census Bureau's Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.  The Metropolitan Council downloaded this data from the Census Bureau's FTP site, imported it into ArcInfo coverage format, added a few items to the coverage, then created block, block group, tract, county subdivision (city), county, taz and water coverages and shape files from the original data.",
