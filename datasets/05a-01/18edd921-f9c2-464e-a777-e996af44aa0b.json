  "dc_description_s": "This file represents the boundaries of all public school districts in the state of Minnesota for school year 2016-2017. Minnesota school districts report any changes to their elementary, middle and high school attendance area boundaries annually. This school district file was dissolved from the statewide attendance boundary file to show just the statewide school district boundaries.  Since 2008, district boundaries have been modified based on county parcels. If parcels are not available then Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Township-Range-Quarter-Quarter Section boundaries are used.",
