The data were obtained through an annual survey sent to communities by the Metropolitan Council and from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data on returned surveys were verified by Metropolitan Council staff through various means. Data from the Residential Construction Branch of the Manufacturing and Construction Division of the U.S. Census Bureau were used if a community did not return the survey. Data may be periodically updated to reflect corrections.",
