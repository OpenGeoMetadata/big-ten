  "dc_description_s": "The 2000 Generalized Land Use dataset encompasses the seven county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota.  The dataset was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area.  The data were interpreted from 2000 air photos, with additional assistance from county parcel data and assessor's information.    The land use classification scheme has been expanded somewhat from that used in previous versions of the generalized land use data.  The following generalized land use classes are used (some of which have subclasses):     Single Family Residential Multifamily Residential Office Retail and Other Commercial Mixed Use Industrial and Utility Extractive Institutional Park, Recreational, or Preserve Golf Course Major Highway Railway Airport Agriculture Undeveloped Water  See Section 5 of the metadata for a detailed description of each of these land use categories and available subcategories.  Note:  This dataset does not attempt to delineate what lands might be considered developable.  This dataset does contain an 'Undeveloped' land category.  The definition of that category can be found in Section 5 of this metadata.  Updated 01/07/03:  The land use codes were changed for two water bodies surrounded by large wetland areas in southwestern Belle Plaine Township and northwestern Maple Plain.  During the original 2000 interpretation, a large area surrounding the open water was also codes as open water for these lakes.  These areas have been updated and are no longer coded as open water.",
