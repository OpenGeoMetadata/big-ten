  "dc_description_s": "Minnesota has 39 agroecoregions. Each agroecoregion is associated with a specific combination of soil types, landscape and climatic features, and landuse. Agroecoregions are units having relatively homogeneous climate, soil and landscapes, and land use/land cover. Agroecoregions can be associated with a specific set of soil and water resource concerns, and with a specific set of management practices to minimize the impact of land use activities on soil and water resource quality.
