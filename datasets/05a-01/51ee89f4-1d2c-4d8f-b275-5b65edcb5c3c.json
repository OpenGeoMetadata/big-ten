  "dc_description_s": "The National Highway System (NHS) consists of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility, and was developed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) in cooperation with the states, local officials, and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs).   National Truck Network is a network of approved routes for commercial truck drivers in the United States. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 authorized the establishment of a national network of highways designated for use by large trucks.   The Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) is a designation given to roads that provide  ''Defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for movements of personnel and Equipment in both peace and war.''  **MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in non-measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the non-measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to obtain. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. **   Check other metadata records in this package for more information on National Highway System, Truck Network, and Strategic Highway Network in Minnesota.",
