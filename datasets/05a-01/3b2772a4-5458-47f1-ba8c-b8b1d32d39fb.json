  "dc_description_s": "The State of Minnesota wetland banking program is authorized by State statutes and associated State rules (Chapter 8420). The program requires that all land being utilized for wetland banking purposes be protected by a State conservation easement, although other land protection mechanisms were used prior to 2000. These protected lands are primarily privately-owned and not accessible to the public without landowner permission. This spatial data layer shows the approximate boundaries of lands protected by State of Minnesota conservation easements and/or other land protection mechanisms associated with the State\u2019s wetland banking program. Information on wetland banking and associated credits can be found at http://bwsr.state.mn.us/wetlands/wetlandbanking/credits.html.",
