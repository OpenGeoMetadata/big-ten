In addition, the data include state park roads and campground spurs. Attributes for each trail or road segment include, among other things, trail/road name, an internally used Program-Project Code, and authorized recreational trail uses. The layer file available through the GDRS and Geospatial Commons provides a wide variety of display options that correspond to these descriptive attributes. These data are intended to be used at a scale of 1:24,000 or smaller. This dataset is known to contain some geometry and attribute errors and is not guaranteed to be accurate.",
