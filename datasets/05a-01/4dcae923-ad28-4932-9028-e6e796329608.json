  "dc_description_s": "Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages a statewide network of water-level observation wells. Data from these wells are used to determine long-term trends, interpret impacts of pumping and climate, plan for water conservation, and otherwise manage the water resource. Soil and Water Conservation Districts under contract with DNR measure the wells and report the readings to DNR. Monthly measurements are typically made from April through November for these wells. DNR has installed automatic data recorders in some observation wells. A set of indicator wells having at least 20 years of measurement records, distributed geographically across the state and in major aquifers used for water supplies, are tracked in monthly Hydrologic Conditions Reports. These indicator observation wells can be used to illustrate trends in groundwater levels around the state relative to the long-term records.  Data for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area are included in this dataset.",
