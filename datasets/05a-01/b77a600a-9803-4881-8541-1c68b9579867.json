  "dc_description_s": "The Growth Management Policy Areas (sometimes called the 2040 Growth Strategy) were developed by Metropolitan Council staff and approved by the Council in December of 1996.  The policy areas are the Urban Core, the Urban Area, the Urban Reserve, Rural Growth Centers and Permanent Rural and Agricultural Areas.  Additionally an Illustrative 2020 MUSA is depicted.  NOTES: - Data were derived from MUSA, MCD and watershed layers - The Illustrative 2020 MUSA category is basically a cartoon.  It was put on the growth management map to convey the idea that there will be an interim 2020 MUSA.  The actual boundaries have yet to be determined and may look VERY different. - The lines between the Permanent Rural and Permanent Agricultural areas will also be more precisely determined in the future.",
