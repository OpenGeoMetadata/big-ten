A sewershed is a defined area that is tributary to a single point along an MCES interceptor pipe (a community connection to an interceptor) or is tributary to a single lift station.  Community boundaries are also used to define sewer-shed boundaries.  The data are derived from community comprehensive sewer plans.    Notes: -  The sewersheds are estimated.  The actual sewersheds may be different. -  Not all records contain county or MCD information.",
