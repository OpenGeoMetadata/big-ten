Communities may also revise their current TAZ forecasts before the 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update.   In the meantime, the Council provides these Current TAZ forecasts for transportation planning.  If you are using TAZ forecasts for analysis and/or transportation planning, please download the latest version of this shapefile to ensure you are using the most up-to-date data.  If you represent a community that wants to revise your TAZ forecasts, please contact your community's sector representative or  Dennis Farmer (see contact information at the end of this document).",
