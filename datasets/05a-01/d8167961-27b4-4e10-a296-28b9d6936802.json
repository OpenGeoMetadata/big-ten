Locations of United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream flow stations are also included. This data set was created as part of MPCA's Environmental Data Access project, which was designed to provide internet access to MPCA's surface water monitoring data. The data set contains locational data and limited attributes for all MPCA stream chemistry stations, MPCA lake monitoring stations, MPCA stream biology stations, MPCA permitted dischargers [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits], and (locations only) of USGS stream flow stations. MPCA lake and stream monitoring stations are the same stations found in MPCA's EQuIS database.",
