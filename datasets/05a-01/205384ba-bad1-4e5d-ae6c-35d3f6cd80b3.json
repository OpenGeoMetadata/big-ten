  "dc_description_s": "This data set contains 4-band natural color and false color infrared (CIR) imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition.  The source files are 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified towithin +/- 4 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using  the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.  The county mosaic files downloadable from the USDA NRCS Geospatial Data Gateway (natural color only, does not include CIR Band 4) were generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. MrSID compression was used. Target values for the compression ratio are 15:1.  (Note: The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) has created this metadata record to describe the entire NAIP 2017 dataset, using information from Farm Service Agency metadata. Each natural color county file available from the USDA NRCS Geospatial Data Gateway is accompanied by the original FSA metadata for that county.)",
