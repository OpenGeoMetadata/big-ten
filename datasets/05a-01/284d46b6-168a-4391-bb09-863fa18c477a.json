Additionally it shows potential areas where surficial flooding could create hazardous conditions for vehicles using those access routes. Features from the NCompass RoadsAllCounties layer were evaluated by their intersection with Flood Impact Zones (FIZ) of the LocalFloodScreening \"bluespots\" layer.
