  "dc_description_s": "The drivable surface material of the roadway. The operational characteristic of a given route segment. Values indicate if the segment is a one-way or two-way road as well as if the segment is a ramp, couplet, unbuilt, non-mainline, or non-inventory direction. Indicates whether a road segment fits the FHWA's criteria for a public road and can be counted as certified miles. Traffic access control determines the through traffic preference for any given drivable roadway surface. Access to roadways can be fully, partial or have no access control. This does not refer to right of way access control, but rather relates to roadway design. The width of the roadway carrying through traffic. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in Non Measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures.
