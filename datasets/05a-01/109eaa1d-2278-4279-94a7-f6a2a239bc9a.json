To make the boundary line up with other data, such as ownership mapped using PLS40NE3, this boundary is based on existing data whenever possible, using PLS40NE3, DNRLKPY3, CTYBDNE2, 1:24000 DRGs, and in several instances, insertion of lines based on the description (for example, connecting two parts of a sixteenth line, when the description indicates that the boundary continues on that line, even though the line does not exist in the Public Land Survey because it would fall within a meandered water body.",
