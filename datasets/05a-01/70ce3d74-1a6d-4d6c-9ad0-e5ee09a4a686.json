  "dc_description_s": "Reference posts (often called Mile Post or Mile Markers) are green numbered signs along the side of a highway roughly a mile apart for traveler reference. Roundabouts are circular intersections designed to control traffic features. These features - including yield control of entering traffic, channelized approaches, and restrictive Geometric curvature and roadway widths - are designed to control travel speeds, facilitate efficient exchange of traffic flows, and minimize the number and severity of vehicle conflicts. Supplemental information of medians and Medians locations. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in Non Measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures.
