  "dc_description_s": "This feature class was created using tree canopy data from a 3 foot reduced resolution land cover raster developed by the University of Vermont and reduced in resolution by the University of Pennsylvania. The land cover data was derived using planimetric and elevation data as the source, acquired in spring 2009.To create the forested areas, the tree canopy features were buffered in 25ft, with the results buffered out 25ft, which performs a crude 50ft check on the data, removing features less than 50ft in. As a result, there is some slight edge loss and smoothing of features, but was deemed insignificant at a scale of countywide significance. To create a minimum area, features with a shape.area less than 10,000 square feet were removed. The results were attributed as forest and unioned with the original tree canopy data, creating a layer containing separate areas of tree canopy and forest.",
