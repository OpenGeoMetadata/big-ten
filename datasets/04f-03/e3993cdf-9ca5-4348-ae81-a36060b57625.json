  "dc_description_s": "The Growth Policy Areas visually communicates where and how growth should evolve as a county over the next 20 years, as well as which parts of the County will not experience substantial change. The Growth Policy area takes into account existing development patterns, environmental features, existing and planned transportation investments, and projected growth and balances these factors with the County\u2019s underlying capacity to meet the needs of existing communities and to accommodate future development. The data in this layer was created by combining existing data for the Growth Boundary from Plan 2035, along with heads up digitizing of the employment areas and future water and sewer areas. It is only a rough representation of the areas, not suitable for analysis at the property level, and meant to be refined with each master and sector plan.
