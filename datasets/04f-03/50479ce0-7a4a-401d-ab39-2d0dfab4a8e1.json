  "dc_description_s": "The Environmental and Parks Easement layer is a graphic representation of areas for conservation in Prince George's County, based on Subtitle 24, Subdivision Regulations, Sections 129-135, of the County Code. These areas include, but not restricted to: cemeteries and related areas, conservation, floodplain, historic, landscape buffer, scenic, stormwater management easements.The features in this layer represent vegetated buffers preserved and/or restored along all regulated streams outside the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Overlay Zones, which at a minimum includes the following features that are delineated as the Primary Management Area or PMA: (A) All regulated streams and associated minimum stream buffers; (B) The one hundred (100) year floodplain as defined by Section 27-124.01; (C) All wetlands and associated wetland buffers that are adjacent to the regulated stream, stream buffer or the one hundred (100) year floodplain; (D) All areas having slopes of fifteen (15%) or greater adjacent to the regulated stream or stream buffer, the one hundred (100) year floodplain, or adjacent wetlands or wetland buffers; (E) Adjacent critical habitat areas.This layer is a non-authoritative resource, indicating the presence of an easement based on information from the recorded final plat which would require additional research and consultation with Planning Department staff when analyzing and researching properties in Prince George's County.This layer is important when making long-range land use planning decisions, and also when on-site development activities occur. It is understood that this layer, for some time to come, will be incomplete, and, it may never be 100% complete simply because of the nature of easements and the fact that they can be established at different times in the process and through different means. The original easement data was recorded up to 2002, known in this layer as legacy data, when updates ceased until project continuation September 2010.",
