  "dc_description_s": "There are four SGA Tiers designated on the SGA Tier map approved by the County Council on November 20, 2012 and enacted through Council Resolution CR-83-2012, based on the definitions found in SB-236, passed by the General Assembly and signed into law in the spring of 2012. Tier I areas are generally comprised of properties in sewer categories 3 and 4. These properties are considered approved for sewer service. Tier II areas are generally comprised of properties in sewer category 5 that are located within the Developed or Developing Tiers. These properties are considered planned for public sewer service. Tier III areas are generally comprised of properties that are not planned or zoned for public sewer service, not planned for preservation, are generally in sewer category 6, and are located in the Rural Tier. Tier IV areas are generally comprised of properties that are not planned or zoned for public sewer service and are planned for conservation of agricultural or forestry uses. These properties are generally in sewer category 6 and are located in the Rural Tier. Residential subdivisions on properties located in Tier IV are limited by the underlying zoning and are limited to a maximum of seven lots, regardless of the size of the property. This plan is amended by the adoption of Plan 2035, per CR-26-2014, available at http://prince.he195.vps.webenabled.net/sites/default/files/documents/DC%20General%20Plan%20Final%20Resolution%20Signed%205-6-2014.pdf.",
