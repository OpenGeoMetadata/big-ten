  "dc_description_s": "As there is intended to be only one plan that actively applies to each property in the county, the Active Community Plan feature class was derived from existing plan boundaries to show only that portion that is active. Over time, a portion or all of and active plan may be superseded. The overlapping portion of a plan boundary that is superseded by a newer plan is removed from this data set and placed into a separate feature class for research purposes. A geodatabase containing feature classes of the superseded portions of each plan, as well as the original complete plan boundary are located on the Planning Department's internal network at J:\\GIS\\Layers\\Community Plans.",
