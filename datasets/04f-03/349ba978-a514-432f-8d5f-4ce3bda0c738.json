  "dc_description_s": "On November 15, 2016, the Military Installation Overlay (M-I-O) was approved by the District Council (CR-97-2016) and defined the Height Limit Areas for the M-I-O. These geographies were originally developed for the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study (AICUZ) (2007). The M-I-O designated five areas of the AICUZ Runway Airspace Imaginary Surfaces as the M-I-O Height Limit Areas: A - Primary Surface for both runways; B - Approach/Departure Clearance (50:1) north and south ends; D - Inner Horizontal Surface for both runways; E - Conical Surface (20:1) for both runways; G - Transitional Surface (7:1) for both runways. The definition/description of Runway Airspace Imaginary Surfaces is from the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, December 2007, p.4-1 to 4-4. Runway airspace imaginary surfaces, in graphical form, are the result of the application of obstruction height criteria to Andrews AFB. Imaginary surfaces are surfaces in space around airfields in relation to runways. The surfaces are designed to define the obstacle-free airspace at and around the airfield. Refer to Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design (http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc_3_260_01.pdf), for a more complete description of runway airspace imaginary surfaces for Class B runways.",
