  "dc_description_s": "Park_Parcels was created to store the geometry of all master (non subunit) M-NCPPC parks in Prince George's County, Maryland. The polygon boundaries do not represent park unit boundaries by definition. Instead, each polygon boundary has been developed to represent acquisition/parcel/lot boundaries. Most park units are aggregations of many lots and parcels. The polygon boundaries have a relationship with, but may deviate from, the property layer as developed by M-NCPPC-Planning. The Park_Parcel polygons were developed to respect the surveys and deeds recorded during the acquisition process.",
