  "dc_description_s": "This feature class contains the locations of multi-family structures within the county. It also has total counts of dwelling units per apartment project, or complex. Where the total count is partially or wholly uncertain, an estimated count is also provided. Ancillary buildings and property associated with the apartment complexes are typically included within the multi-family shapes. The primary reference source used to create this layer was the Multi-family database maintained by the Data Systems Section. Additional information (estimated units, missing multi-family structures and complexes) was added via supplemental sources (such as the City of Laurel) and on-line research. Note that the extent of the complex boundaries is approximate, and do not represent official boundaries. The tally of units per complex is subject to change and is not an official count.",
