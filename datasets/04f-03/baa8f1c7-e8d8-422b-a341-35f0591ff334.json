  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains impervious surfaces within Prince George's County. Impervious surfaces are attributed by type. All remaining surfaces that do not fall under one of the 'Type' categories are classified as pervious. Impervious Surface features derived as a byproduct of the photogrammetric capture of planimetric features, for use in general mapping at a scale of 1:1200, using stereo imagery taken to satisfy creation of 6 inch ground pixel resolution orthophotography. The original data was developed using photography taken from March of 2009. It was then updated in 2014 using photography taken during March/April of 2014.",
