  "dc_description_s": "This was created based on a description of the accident potential zone in the 1993 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington (formerly Andrews Air Force Base). The boundaries of each zone was entered using ARC/INFO COGO. The associated attributes were added and the zones used to identify the potential for accidents as a guide for the intensity of development permitted based on the AICUZ Study. On November 15, 2016, the Military Installation Overlay was approved by the District Council (CR-97-2016) which includes but did not change the geographies for the accident potential zones.",
