  "dc_description_s": "This was created based on the digitized noise contours as found in the 2007 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington. The associated attributes were entered and the zones used to identify the noise impacts associated with development proposed in the vicinity of Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington. On November 15, 2016, the Military Installation Overlay was approved by the District Council (CR-97-2016) which created the Noise Intensity Zone and High Noise Intensity Zone. The two zones were based on the AICUZ noise contours. The Noise Intensity Zone contain the areas effected by noise in the 60 dB to 74 dB range. The High Noise Intensity Zone contains the areas effected by noise 75 dB or higher surrounding Joint Base Andrews.",
