  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows the archived boundaries of the three tiers (Developed, Developing, and Rural) established through approval of the 2002 Prince George\u2019s County General Plan. The Plan Prince George\u2019s 2035 Approved General Plan (Plan 2035) replaces the 2002 Prince George\u2019s County Approved General Plan, per CR-26-2014 and introduces new terminology for county geographies.  With the approval of Plan 2035, tiers and corridors are no longer used to guide county growth.  Plan 2035 does not change existing laws, fees, ordinances, or guidelines associated with the 2002 General Plan tiers. The tier boundaries are archived for the sole purpose of facilitating continued implementation of certain county guidelines and ordinances that refer to 2002 General Plan tiers.\u200b Transition maps have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the Landscape Manual, Regulated Environmental Protection Areas, and Adequate Public Pedestrian and Bikeway Facility Areas which should be consulted for geographies related to relevant ordinances and guidelines.",
