They are feature classes within the geodatabase Clark_Transportation_2017.gdb. [This is the Roads Centerline coverage derived from the 1997 air photos. It is the public road centerline layer but also contains private driveways that are longer in length. Road classes are identified for each centerline-only primary forest roads are included in this layer. Additional forest roads are maintained in a separate layer maintained by the Forestry Department.. The data is updated when mistakes are found or when information is provided by the owning entity.]",
