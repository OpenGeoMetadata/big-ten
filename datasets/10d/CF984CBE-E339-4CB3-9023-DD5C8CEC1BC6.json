Cooperative Educational Service Agencies are intermediate service agencies that provide programs, services, and resources to a region of school districts in the state of Wisconsin. This dataset was assembled using county-derived school district boundary data and school district information from the Department of Public Instruction website. CESA numbers are associated with each school district and are current as of 2017. The school district boundaries in this dataset are dated 2017 because they do not reflect boundary changes that will take effect July 1, 2018.]",
