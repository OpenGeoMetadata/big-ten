  "dc_description_s": "This dataset includes boundaries for secondary school district boundaries within the state of Wisconsin. By law, all territory in the state must be included within a public school district. The US Census Bureau identifies three types of school districts. Unifiedschool districts serve children of all grade levels, Elementary primarialy serve students in the elementary grades, and Secondary primarily serve children in grades 9-12. Out of 421 school districts in Wisconsin, 10 are considered secondary districts.This layer is an aggregate of county-submitted data for school district boundaries.Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. In 2019, there were no reorganizations involving secondary district boundaries.",
