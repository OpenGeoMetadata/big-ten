  "dc_description_s": "[This dataset includes boundaries for elementary school district boundaries within the state of Wisconsin. By law, all territory in the state must be included within a public school district. The US Census Bureau identifies three types of school districts. Unified school districts serve children of all grade levels, Elementary serve primarily students in the elementary grades, and Secondary primarily serve children in grades 9-12. Out of 422 school districts in Wisconsin, 43 are considered elementary districts. This layer is an aggregate of county-submitted data for school district boundaries.Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. In 2018, there were two (2) reorganizations that involved elementary school districts. One reorganization was a consolidation in Washington County of the Friess Lake School District and the Richfield Jt. 1 School Districts and the creation of the Holy Hill School District which comprises the total territory of the two former elementary districts. The other reorganization took place in Iron County and involved a small parcel transfer from Hurley School District (unified) to North Lakeland School District (elementary) and Lakeland UHS (secondary).Please refer to the property transfer logfor more information.]",
