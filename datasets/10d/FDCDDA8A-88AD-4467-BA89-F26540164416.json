These various documents were brought together to create tax parcels, easements, road right-of-ways, and other graphic features that support tax parcel map generation. This map provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and is suitable for its intended purpose. It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds.]",
