  "dc_description_s": "This dataset includes boundaries for elementary school district boundaries within the state of Wisconsin. By law, all territory in the state must be included within a public school district. The US Census Bureau identifies three types of school districts. Unifiedschool districts serve children of all grade levels, Elementary primarialy serve students in the elementary grades, and Secondaryprimarily serve children in grades 9-12. Out of 421 school districts in Wisconsin, 44 are considered secondary districts.This layer is an aggregate of county-submitted data for school district boundaries.Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. In 2019, there were no reorganizations involving elementary district boundaries.In the initial school district boundary collection in 2017, DPI did not receive any data layers from GIS officials in Milwaukee County so Milwaukee County's elementary districts were based off Census boundaries. Walworth County's 2017 data submission to DPI only included unified and secondary districts so the elementary district boundaries were generate from the V3 statewide parcel layer. In this third edition of elementary school district boundaries, the boundary lines within Milwaukee and Walworth counties were redone to match data taken from each county's Open Data portal.",
