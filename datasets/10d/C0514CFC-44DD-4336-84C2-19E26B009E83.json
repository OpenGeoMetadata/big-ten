The data was derived from a variety of sources including U.S. General Land Office Survey Plats & notes, recorded deed descriptions, subdivision maps, recored Certified Survey Maps, filed plats/maps of survey, easements, highway and right-of-way plats. These source materials are of differing scales and date from the mid 1800's to the present. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and it is suitable for its intended use. It is not to be used for the determination of actual land title or to be in any way a substitute for land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds. Parcel boundaries that are not surveyed are mapped based on the best interpretation of the recorded legal descriptions.]",
