It is a feature class within the geodatabase \u201cTaylor_Addresses_2013.gdb\u201d. The feature layers included in this geodatabase are \u201cAddress_Points_Structure_Access\u201d and \u201cTaylor_Addresses_2013\u201d.[Address_Points_Structure_Access: This data set consists of digital map files containing addressing or site access information obtained by lab work. Features contained in the data set include all site access points countywide and associated attributes. Features contained in the data set include all site access points countywide and associated attributes. Site access points sometimes are referred to as addresses, however these data typically represent the intersection of the public road right of way and the private entrance to the property. In urban areas the site access is represented at the located where the primary structure is perpendicular to the public road right of way. The Taylor County Land Information Office plans to maintain this digital data in geodatabase format in an ESRI ArcSDE environment using ArcMap tools.Taylor_Addresses: Buildings represent a collection of points spatially located over the main building for any given address. For the most part, in urban areas, there is not a building point located unless the main building would not be physically visible from the road. The data was developed to only show the main structure for a given address, meaning that there is only one building point per address. In the case of duplexes or multi family structures additional building points and site access points are added. By only having one building point per address and one site access point, a one to one relationship is maintained with the site access point.]",
