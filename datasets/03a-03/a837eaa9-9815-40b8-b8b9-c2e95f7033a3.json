  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data coverage was derived from the Iowa county soil surveys that were digitized by the Iowa Cooperative Soil Survey (ICSS), which includes the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, and Iowa State University, Cooperative Extension Service and Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station. The final coverages for each county were then assembled by the Iowa Geological & Water Survey. All rock units that were denoted at the surface and within 30\" of the surface dependent upon soil type for the individual counties were filtered respectively and combined into a composite coverage depicting the distribution of bedrock exposures across Iowa. This polygon coverage was then intersected with the bedrock geologic map to categorize the exposures to the geologic bedrock outcrop map units.",
