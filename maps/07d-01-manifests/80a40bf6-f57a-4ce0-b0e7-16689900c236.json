  "dc_description_s": "Relief shown pictorially. The state of this map varies from Blaeu, Hondius and Jansson versions according to van der Krogt in Koeman's, \"New title cartouche with coat-of-arms and human figures, copied after Blaeu's unsigned map. Characteristic difference: Blaeu has a one line Latin quotation ('Turribus... Bituris') between the two towers bottom right.\" As there is no text on the verso, the map does not match any states recorded in Van der Krogt. Includes decorative title cartouche and scale cartouche with two towers, armillary sphere, and books. From the Jansson Appendix Atlas 1636-1680, title created to represent a unique collection within the Clark Library, University of Michigan. 1 map; 45 x 55 cm. This map is in the public domain. Please attribute access and use of this digitized map to the Stephen S. Clark Library, University of Michigan Library.",
