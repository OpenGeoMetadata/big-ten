Illustrated cartouche by \"D.L.R. inv. & del.\" with motto \"Tu regere imperio populos brittanne memento.\" \"Advertisement: For the new and interesting particulars with which this map is enriched, especially in the Northern parts, we are chiefly indebted for the geographic description of Father Joseph Tieffenthaler, Apostolic Missionary in India, and to the curious draft of the Ganges and Gagra by Monsr. Anquetil du Perron. The new chorographical map of the Southern counties of India by Col. Kelly, has enabled us to reform in several districts, the geography hitherto adopted for the Southermost part of the peninsula.\" 1 map : color ; 71 x 53 cm",
